# LeetCode
Where I keep all my LeetCode solutions.

Feel free to look through the solutions (varying difficulty for each challenge, 'easy', 'medium', and 'hard'); code will most likely be written in Python3, Java, and sometimes C++ (if I enjoy the headache and have enough coffee).

ALL SOLUTIONS ARE CORRECT AND PASSED!
